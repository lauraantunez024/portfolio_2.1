## Description
This is my third attempt at a professional portfolio website, the second time with React. By far my best attempt, although I owe it to freecodecamp.com for their tutorial! This portfolio includes An about me, skills and languages, testimonials and contact information. 



## Usage
Feel free to use the code! But link to original code and instructions can be seen below in the credit section.

## Credits
Thank you to [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/) website for providing me with such a great foundation for the project. I used their basic structure and made some minor changes to the contact section. Shoutout to Reed Barger, the author of the article, for their tutorial!
